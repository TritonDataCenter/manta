# SDKs and CLI Tools

There are several language packages (Software Development Kits, SDKs) for Manta.
The Node.js and Java SDKs are maintained by Joyent.


# Node.js SDK

The Node.js SDK is used to develop and to test Manta. It is the most robust SDK
available for Manta.

The Node.js SDK includes a command-line interface that provides several
tools that let you work with Manta much as you would work with a Unix system.
See the [Getting Started tutorial](./#getting-started) for an introduction.

The documentation for using the Manta node.js package in node code, see
[the node-manta docs](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/node-manta/tree/master/docs).


# Java SDK

The Java SDK has feature parity with the Node.js SDK. However, if new features
are released it may be late to implement them. It supports all object operations
and HTTP signing.

The Java SDK is available as a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) module. To use
it add the following to your project's pom.xml:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.joyent.manta</groupId>
        <artifactId>java-manta-client</artifactId>
        <!-- replace this value with the specific version number -->
        <version>LATEST</version>
    </dependency>

You can find the source for Java SDK at
[https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/java-manta](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/java-manta).


# Other community or unsupported SDKs

## Python SDK

The Python SDK is a community-maintained package for Manta, providing
a "manta" package and `mantash`, a shell that lets you work with Manta in
a bash-like environment.

    # Mantash single commands can be run like:
    #       mantash ls
    # Or you can enter the mantash interactive shell and run commands from
    # there. Let's do that:
    $ mantash
    [jill@us-east /jill/stor]$ ls
    [jill@us-east /jill/stor]$                      # our stor is empty
    [jill@us-east /jill/stor]$ put numbers.txt ./   # upload local file
    [jill@us-east /jill/stor]$ ls
    numbers.txt
    [jill@us-east /jill/stor]$ cat numbers.txt
    one
    two
    three
    four

You can find the Python SDK at
[https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/python-manta](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/python-manta).


## Ruby SDK

The Ruby SDK is a client for communicating with Manta. It is effectively
an HTTP(S) wrapper which handles required HTTP headers and performs some sanity
checks. The Ruby SDK seeks to expose all of Manta's features in a thin
low-abstraction client.

You can find the Ruby SDK at
[https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/ruby-manta](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/ruby-manta).


## mantaRSDK

The R SDK is an interactive client in the form of an R package, that exposes all
of Manta's features, and supports R on Unix, Linux and Windows.

You can find the mantaRSDK at
[https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/mantaRSDK](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/mantaRSDK)
and Rbunyan at [https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/Rbunyan](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/Rbunyan).


## Hadoop FileSystem Driver

Hadoop can natively access Manta over the network. Most major Hadoop FileSystem
features are supported. This is a community driven project, so updates to it are
dependent upon community involvement. The driver is available as a stand-alone
jar file that can be dropped into a Hadoop or Apache Drill installation.

You can download the jar directory from the [releases
page](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/hadoop-manta/releases)
on the [project's github page](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/hadoop-manta)
or directly from Maven Central.


## PHP SDK

The PHP SDK supports all object operations. It is a community driven SDK, so
updates to it are dependent upon community involvement. The SDK is available as
a [Packagist package](https://packagist.org/packages/joyent/php-manta) and can
be installed using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

    composer require joyent/php-manta

It has been tested in PHP 5.6, PHP 7.0 and HHVM.

You can find the source for PHP SDK at
[https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/php-manta](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/php-manta).


## Perl Module

There is a Perl module available via CPAN that supports object operations. It is
a community driven module, so updates to it are dependent upon community
involvement. The module is available on
[CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/~andrewh/Manta-Client/).

You can find the source for the Perl module at
[https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/Manta-Client](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/Manta-Client).


## Golang SDK

The Go SDK for Manta is a combination SDK that provides support for Triton
CloudAPI operations in addition to Manta API operations.

You can find the source for the Go Manta SDK at
[https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/triton-go](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/triton-go).


## Erlang SDK

The Erlang SDK for Manta is community-maintained SDK that has support for most
file operations.

You can find the source for the Erlang SDK at
[https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/erlang-manta](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/erlang-manta).
