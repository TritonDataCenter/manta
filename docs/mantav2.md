# Mantav2

Starting November 2019, there will be two separate active versions of Manta:

- "mantav1" - a long term support branch of Manta that maintains current
  Manta features.
- "mantav2" - a new major version of Manta that adds and removes some
  major features, and becomes the focus of future Manta development.

At this time mantav1 is the recommended version for production usage, but
that is expected to change to mantav2 during 2020.

More details coming soon.
